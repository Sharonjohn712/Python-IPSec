# CS 7530 Advanced Cryptography - Implementation and Optimization of IPSec Site-to-Site VPN in Cloud Environments
This project implements a secure IPsec-based site-to-site VPN to enable encrypted communication between cloud-hosted virtual machines.
It uses AES-256 encryption to ensure data confidentiality and integrity, and incorporates packet compression to optimize network performance and reduce latency.
The solution was deployed and evaluated in a cloud environment, with traffic analysis and validation performed using Wireshark.
